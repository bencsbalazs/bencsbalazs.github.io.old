# Today is a good day for a good day

Are you sick? Have stupid peoples? Do yo have a hard job?

> Dont worry! Calm down!

As I mentioned before, there were many problems and more things in my life that hard to live with. Most of them were unbelivable, but this is not the end.
Just to remember:

- brainstem inflammation
- had to take steroids
  - distention
  - being agressive
- thigh fracture
- tynnitus

- stress
- bad relationships
- solitude
- parents divorced

However, these are only unfortunate events. Nothing can stop living. I realized, and sometime everyone will, that the fortune is just a word.

# The one what people call as fortune, is a state when there are both preparedness and opportunity

Maybe someone wanna know, why I changed the language to English... so, the answer is quite simple. Too many bad and sad events happened with me in my life. You can never start a new life, but you can start a new day in every time you wake up.

> The important thing I had to understand is, I have enough energy for everything; but **I don't want to spend it for unnecessery things.**

Maybe I'm a bit old to realize such kind of things...
