# Today is a good day for a good day

Are you sick? Have stupid peoples? Do yo have a hard job?

> Dont worry! Calm down!

As I mentioned before, there were many problems and more things in my life hard to live. Most of them were unbelivable.
Just to remember:

- brainstem inflammation
- had to take steroids
  - distention
  - being agressive
- thigh fracture
- tynnitus

- stress
- bad relationships
- solitude
