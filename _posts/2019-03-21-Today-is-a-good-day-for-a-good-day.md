Are you sick? Have stupid peoples? Do yo have a hard job?

> Dont worry! Calm down!

As I mentioned before, there were many problems and more things in my life that hard to live with. Most of them were unbelivable.
Just to remember:

- brainstem inflammation
- had to take steroids
  - distention
  - being agressive
- thigh fracture
- tynnitus

- stress
- bad relationships
- solitude
- parents divorced

However, these are only unfortunate events. Nothing can stop living. I realized, and sometime everyone will, that the fortune is just a word.
